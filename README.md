# Fiorix FPV Hub  
Welcome to Fiorix FPV Hub! This repository serves as a central index for all my FPV drone-related projects. Below, you'll find links to my repositories, each focused on different aspects of the FPV ecosystem.

## 🚁 Repositories  
Here are the key projects:

### 5. [Rotorhazard CSI Toolkit](https://github.com/FiorixF1/csi_export)
Description: a collection of plugins for RotorHazard aimed at race management of CSI Drone Racing events. It includes creation of classes and heats, custom overlays, class ranking, data export and a fancy management panel for the race director, all in a single solution.

### 4. [Rotorhazard Class Rank Brackets](https://github.com/FiorixF1/RotorHazard-Class-Rank-Brackets)

### 1. [HDZero VTX Coppa Italia firmware](https://github.com/FiorixF1/hdzero-vtx)
Description: a custom version of the HDZero VTX firmware that limits the maximum power to 25 mW and locks the offset to 0, as required by Coppa Italia rules book.

### 2. [HDZero Programmer](https://github.com/FiorixF1/hdzero-programmer)
Description: a fork of the HDZero Programmer that can identify the firmware version installed on the VTX. It has been created with the intention to verify if a pilot has the Coppa Italia firmware installed on their VTX, but it can be used to identify any other version. It also adds the compatibility on Linux.
